# Black-and-Trancparency-converter

This is a program meant to convert color or grayscale images into ones only made of black pixels of varying transparency. 
<br/> <br/>
You can use this to convert scans of pencil/ink drawings into lineart useable in painting software, you can also use it to recolor pictures...
<br/>
Here's a preview:<br/><br/>
Suppose I want to color it this pencil drawing by @dawning-crow <br/>

<b>I could used the magic wand tool, or the blending options in photoshop to remove the white pixels, but you end up with this: <b/>
| Either the threshold is too low, and the gray pixels are visible and very noticeable:| Or the threshold is too high, and you lose a lot of the lineart in the process:|
|----|----|

<b>If you use this program though, you keep all the detail while still avoiding the gray pixel artefacts: <b/> <br/>
